# Marketing-Mix-Model
Marketing in the present age is really challenging and tough as customers are no longer limiting themselves to just the traditional channels during the buying process. In fact, customers surf multiple channels to extract the maximum value and best deals from the brand, its competitors and substitutes. This can be attributed to all the information available on social media. Earlier, the budget was allocated between traditional media and print but now additional channels such as SEO, Facebook, Mobile and other social media channels need to be considered.
So, it all comes down to how the marketing budget needs to be allocated among these different platforms to get the maximum exposures. For this problem we are going consider the following:
1. Channels: Print, TV, SEO, Facebook, Mobile Advertising (we can scale to more channels if required).
2. Diminishing exposures/returns for each of these channels.
3. Constraints on the marketing expenses and costs associated with each channel.
4. Fixed costs and minimum costs for each channel.

This model is designed using Pyomo (a Python package). The output is a file showing budget to be allocated based on the exposures at different ranges of Budgets for each channel.
